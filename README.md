# hexapawn-ai
Hexapawn(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapawn) Artificial Intelligence Bot written in Python. 

# Info
Uses Python with `random` library. Uses random guesses to choose a movement. If the movement caused the computer to loose, it is excluded from the variable.

# Instructions
In the program, when you choose the situation you should format it as `s <situatuation number>` without any blank space. If the game ends before round 6, input `4` and write `y` for computer wins and `n` for human wins. The possible situation and its number can be found in `situations.jpg` (sorry for bad quality, I'll upload a new one).

# Data
Some collected data from actual playing with the computer can be found in `DATA.txt`. It is actual copy/paste from terminal input and output.

# Requirements for playing
- Python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/ is the latest version at the time of writing)
- A computer
- A chess board(only 9 squares used) or a DIY solution
